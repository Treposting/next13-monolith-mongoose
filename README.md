# Next.js 13 Monolithic Application with MongoDB (Mongoose)

## Overview
This project is a monolithic architecture web application built with Next.js 13, leveraging Next.js's built-in routing system for handling navigation. MongoDB is used as the database, and Mongoose serves as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool for data management.

## Features
- List the key features and functionalities of your application.

## Technologies Used
- **Next.js 13:** A popular React framework for building web applications with a powerful built-in routing system.
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database used for storing and managing data.
- **Mongoose:** An ODM (Object-Document Mapper) for MongoDB, making it easier to work with MongoDB in Node.js.

## Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:
- **Node.js:** You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Treposting/next13-monolith-mongoose.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd next13-monolith-mongoose
   ```

3. Install project dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up the MongoDB connection:
   - Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project.
   - Add your MongoDB connection string:
     ```env
     MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
     ```

5. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Your application should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
